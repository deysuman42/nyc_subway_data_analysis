# nyc_subway_data_analysis

In this Project, I analyzed NYC Subway Data to find out whether more people ride the subway when it’s raining versus when it’s not.

The process involved is as folows: -

1. Data gathering through web scrapping using urllib and beautifulsoupui.
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Map Reduce operation.
